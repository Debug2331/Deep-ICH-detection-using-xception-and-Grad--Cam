🧠 Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection using Deep Learning
Welcome! This project uses deep learning to automatically detect and classify intracranial hemorrhages in brain CT scans. It’s designed to support doctors with fast, accurate, and explainable diagnoses.

🚀 What This Project Does
Uses the Xception model for high-accuracy image classification

Applies Grad-CAM to generate heatmaps that highlight hemorrhage areas

Uses segmentation techniques and OpenCV to measure hemorrhage spread

Classifies severity (low/high) to help assess urgency

Aims to assist medical professionals with timely decision-making

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

Grad-CAM

Xception Model

CT Scan Dataset (publicly available or hospital-provided)

📈 Features
End-to-end training and evaluation pipeline

Visual heatmap outputs for model explainability

Quantitative analysis of hemorrhage spread

Severity classification (e.g., low or high risk)

Modular and easy to customize

🩻 Why This Matters
Intracranial hemorrhage is a medical emergency. Early and accurate detection can save lives. This tool aims to support radiologists and medical practitioners with a faster and smarter diagnosis process, using AI-powered insights.
